Feature

1. Email and password regular expression check
2. network check
3. refresh lost on pulling down
4. load more on reaching the end
5. save token to keychain for login session
6. save member list to user default for showing in offline mode
7. logout to clear the token



P.S 
For some reason I did't test the app with a real device, all are based on what I see on simulator
